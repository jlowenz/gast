# GPU-Accelerated Symmetry Transform

This module computes the composite magnitude and primary direction of the symmetry axis for each pixel in an image. 

This repository implements the algorithm from the paper:

    Reisfeld, Daniel, Haim Wolfson, and Yehezkel Yeshurun. “Context Free Attentional Operators: The Generalized Symmetry Transform.” Int. J. Comput. Vision 14 (1995): 119–30.

with some ideas taken from the paper:

    Kootstra, Gert, Niklas Bergstrom, and Danica Kragic. “Using Symmetry to Select Fixation Points for Segmentation.” In Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2010 20th International Conference on, 3894–3897. IEEE, 2010. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5597580.
